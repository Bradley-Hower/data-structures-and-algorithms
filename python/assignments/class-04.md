# Class 04 - Code Challenges - Matrix Sum

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The problem was simple enough to grasp. I began by illustrating the problem as how the data would flow from the inner arrays to the new array. After the vizualization was clear, I wrote out the plain English logic, patching any gaps in my writing to be sure that all necessary lines of code were included. Finally, I was able to cleanly write the code according to what I could remember for methods of Python. Hopefully my memory was correct and I didn't miss anything.

## Solution

Call the matrix_condenser function with the matrix as the argument. The function will sum the inner arrays and push these inner array sums to a new array.
