# Class 02 - Code Challenges - Insert and shift an Array in Middle at Index

"Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index."

## Approach & Efficiency

This time around I worked to follow the process as outlined by JB in the class lecture and the white board checklist. I found this to be immensely helpful at building a clean process for solving these sorts of problems. I think it was helpful to be able to outline the tasks at hand, and to be able to put the code into words. The actual code might be off due to me be unfamiliar with Python method names. However, I will use this as a learning process to see which ones I should have used.

## Solution

This would be ran by calling the inserShiftArray function with the array and value arguments within parenthesis.
