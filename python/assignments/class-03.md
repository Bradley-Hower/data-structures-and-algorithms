## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

With the concept in mind, I set to make the visual quite quickly, as the test cases are not very varying. I then wrote out the logic in plain English, without too much difficulty, realizes that the goal was to push the mid target to the new mid for the left and right numbers with each iteration. After a certain number of runs, it is presumed that the target is found. By readin g thorugh my plain English version it made it a lot easier to see where any mistakes in logic were. I then set to write the code, which was quite non-technical and easy enough to achieve.

## Solution

Call the BinarySearch function with the lowest, highest and target figures, in that order, as arguments. Once found, there will be a print out of the target figure having been found.
