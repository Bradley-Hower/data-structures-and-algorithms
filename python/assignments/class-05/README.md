# Class 05 - Code Challenge - Linked List Implementation

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Moreover, can return string printout of linked list and has validator to confirm if value is within linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

My process of solving this was a more fundamental. I went one by one through the tests to understand what they were looking for. Parts I didn't understand, I went online to find how linked lists work to find the right part to fit. With some logical thinking, I was able to implement aspects that were not already there in the code chunks I found online.

## Solution

Run `pytest` to confirm functionality.

Linked lists can be initialized and values added with the following:

```
linked_list = LinkedList()

linked_list.insert("apple")
```
