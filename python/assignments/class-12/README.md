# Class 11 - Code Challenge - First-in, First out Animal Shelter

Creating an animal shelter which houses cats and dogs. These dogs and cats are seperated and are processed in a first-in, first-out approach.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

This is a project which implements a bit of two projects. The previous pythonic band one and the enqueue. The key is that the Cat and Dog classes are subclasses of Animal.

## Solution

Run `pytest` to confirm functionality.

1. Creat virtual environment:  `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Freeze requirements: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
4. Install test: `pip install pytest`

Note, sometimes pytest needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled if it was previous installed under another directory.
